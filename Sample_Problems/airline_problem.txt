This .lp file can be read into a solver (CPLEX, Gurobi, etc.)

x = Airplane 1 (one pilot)
y = Airplane 2 (one pilot)

We need to miniimize the number of pilots.

Constraint 1 = Passenger Seats
Constraint 2 = Flight Attendants

Bounds:
    There cannot be more than 26 of Airplane 1 or 13 or Airplane 2.
